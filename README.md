# BlockGame
 
Game idea

->  Player is a block of color
->  Every CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME color of the block changes

->  Enemies are block of colors as well
->  Serveral block of colors are


HOW TO PLAY 
->  Player has to dodge incoming enemies 
->  Enemies blocks fall from the sky
->  Player has to dodge incoming enemies blocks
->  However, color matching with the player color might drop as well
->  Player doesnt have to dodge them 
->  Those blocks could even be used as power drops

OBJECTIVES
->  As player keeps dodging enemies
->  More enemies could fall from the sky
->  Some could even be larger or smaller blocks


PERKS
->  Maybe some blocks fall faster than the other
->  Maybe some MATCHING BLOCKS drop power off where the player blocks can move 
several places in one second.
